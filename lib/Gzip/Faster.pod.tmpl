=head1 NAME

Gzip::Faster - gzip and gunzip, without the fuss

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "synopsis.pl" | xtidy %]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module compresses to and decompresses from the gzip format.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 gzip

    my $zipped = gzip ($stuff);

This compresses C<$stuff> into the gzip format. The return value is
the compressed version of C<$stuff>.

=head2 gunzip

    my $stuff = gunzip ($zipped);

This uncompresses C<$zipped> and returns the result of the
uncompression. It returns the undefined value if C<$zipped> is the
undefined value or an empty string. Otherwise, it throws a fatal error
if C<$zipped> is not in the gzip format.

=head2 gzip_file

    my $zipped = gzip_file ('file');

This reads the contents of F<file> into memory and then runs L</gzip>
on the file's contents. The return value and the possible errors are
the same as L</gzip>, plus this may also throw an error if C<open>
fails.

=head2 gunzip_file

    my $stuff = gunzip_file ('file.gz');

This reads the contents of F<file.gz> into memory and then runs
L</gunzip> on the file's contents. The return value and the possible
errors are the same as L</gunzip>, plus this may also throw an error
if C<open> fails.

=head2 gzip_to_file

    gzip_to_file ($plain, 'file.gz');

This compresses C<$plain> in memory using L</gzip> and writes the
compressed content to 'file.gz'. There is no return value. The errors
are the same as L</gzip>, plus this may also throw an error if C<open>
fails. As of this version, it does not write any gzip header
information to F<file.gz>.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

This section compares the performance of Gzip::Faster with
L<IO::Compress::Gzip>/L<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> and
L<Compress::Raw::Zlib>. According to my results, Gzip::Faster is about
five times faster to load, seven times faster to compress, and
twenty-five times faster to uncompress than the IO::Uncompress
modules. Round trips are about ten times faster with Gzip::Faster.

Compared to the L<Compress::Raw::Zlib> modules, load times are about
one and a half times faster, round trips are about three times faster,
compression is about two and a half times faster, and decompression is
about six times faster.

The versions used in this test are as follows:

[% versions | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of load times:

[% load | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of a round-trip:

[% round | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gzip (compression) only:

[% gzip | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gunzip (decompression) only:

[% gunzip | indent (4) %]

The test file is in "examples/benchmark.pl" in the distribution.

=head1 BUGS

The module source code includes disabled functionality to round-trip
Perl flags. I applied this to preserving Perl's "utf8" flag. However,
the mechanism I used trips a browser bug in the Firefox web browser
where it produces a content encoding error message. Thus this
functionality is disabled. Please refer to the file
F<gzip-faster-perl.c> in the distribution, the relevant parts are
commented out with a macro C<COPY_PERL>.

The module doesn't check whether the input of L</gzip> is already
gzipped, and it doesn't check whether the compression was
effective. That is, it doesn't check whether the output of L</gzip> is
actually smaller than the input.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Gzip::Faster requires the compression library C<zlib> (also called
C<libz>) to be installed. The following message printed during perl
Makefile.PL:

    Warning (mostly harmless): No library found for -lz

or the following message at run-time:

    undefined symbol: inflate

indicate that Gzip::Faster was unable to link to C<libz>.

=head2 Ubuntu Linux

On Ubuntu Linux, you may need to install C<zlib1g-dev> using the
following command:

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

L<Compress::Raw::Zlib>.
